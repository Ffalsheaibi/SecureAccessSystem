# Tuwaiq ESP32 Project

This project showcases a professional implementation of an ESP32-based system using the ILI9341 TFT display. Developed as part of an advanced training initiative with Tuwaiq Academy, it includes real-time sensor integration and an interactive UI.

## Features

- ESP32 microcontroller
- ILI9341 TFT Display with graphical interface
- Live sensor data visualization (e.g., temperature, humidity)
- Visual feedback using display and LEDs
- Expandable for other peripherals and enhancements

## Development Environment

- Platform: Arduino
- Language: C++
- Simulator: Wokwi (for testing without hardware)

## How to Use

1. Open `sketch.ino` in the Arduino IDE or Wokwi.
2. Upload to ESP32.
3. Observe the display output and sensor readings.

## License

This project is developed for educational purposes in collaboration with Tuwaiq Academy.
